Two players A and B are watching as a boy is tossing a coin.
The player A says, lets say that we write down results of
tosses so that if it is a head we write H and if it is tail
we write T. I think that a sequcen HHH has more chances to
appear than HTH, so playes A bets that HHH will be first and
player B bets that HTH will appear first.
How is going to win A or B?
